# Release Checklist

Use this checklist before publishing a new release of Funplay MCP for Cocos.

## 1. Repository Hygiene

- [ ] `git status` contains only intended release changes
- [ ] No tracked local junk is present (`.DS_Store`, `.idea/`, `node_modules/`, `Library/`, `Temp/`, `dist/`, `build/`)
- [ ] `package.json` version matches the intended release
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` includes the release notes for the target version
- [ ] Every GitHub issue resolved by the release is referenced by number and link in `CHANGELOG.md`
- [ ] `README.md` and `README_CN.md` match the current product behavior

## 2. Automated Verification

- [ ] `npm run check` passes
- [ ] `npm test` passes
- [ ] `npm run docs:check` passes
- [ ] `npm run release:check` passes
- [ ] `npm run pack:dry-run` passes
- [ ] `npm run registry:validate` passes when `mcp-publisher` is available
- [ ] `npm run release:package` creates `releases/<version>/`
- [ ] `shasum -a 256 -c releases/<version>/SHA256SUMS.txt` passes
- [ ] `releases/<version>/RELEASE_NOTES.md` is organized by change type, such as Added/Optimized/Changed/Fixed

## 3. Package Contents

- [ ] The zip is named `Funplay.CocosMcp.v<version>.zip`
- [ ] The zip contains a single top-level `funplay-cocos-mcp/` folder
- [ ] The zip contains runtime files: `package.json`, `browser.js`, `scene.js`, `panel/`, and `lib/`
- [ ] The zip contains stdio wrapper metadata: `bin/funplay-cocos-mcp.js` and `server.json`
- [ ] The zip includes docs: `README.md`, `README_CN.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `LICENSE`
- [ ] The zip does not contain `.git/`, `.github/`, `.DS_Store`, `node_modules/`, `Library/`, `Temp/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `test/`, or `scripts/`
- [ ] Release packaging sensitive-content scan does not find npm/GitHub/MCP tokens or private keys
- [ ] `release-manifest.json` references the correct GitHub download URL
- [ ] `SHA256SUMS.txt` includes the zip, manifest, generated release notes, and release README

## 4. Cocos Smoke Test

- [ ] Test in a clean Cocos Creator `3.8+` project
- [ ] Install from the generated zip into `<project>/extensions/funplay-cocos-mcp`
- [ ] Restart Cocos Creator or reload extensions
- [ ] Open `Funplay > MCP Server`
- [ ] Start the MCP server successfully
- [ ] If the configured port is already in use, verify automatic fallback is reported clearly
- [ ] Run a read-only tool such as `get_project_info`
- [ ] Run a scene inspection tool such as `get_scene_info`
- [ ] Run a screenshot tool when the editor has a visible scene or preview
- [ ] Verify interaction logs appear in the MCP Server panel

## 5. MCP Client Verification

- [ ] Verify at least one primary client can connect (`Claude Code`, `Cursor`, `Codex`, etc.)
- [ ] Confirm `tools/list` returns the expected `core` profile tools
- [ ] Confirm a tool call succeeds end-to-end from the external client
- [ ] Verify one-click config output still matches the documented config snippets
- [ ] Verify the stdio wrapper can connect with `funplay-cocos-mcp --url http://127.0.0.1:8765/`

## 6. npm And MCP Registry Readiness
